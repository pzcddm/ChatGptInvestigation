When you book locally with Kallective Wellness CPR, you'll enjoy a number of benefits that you simply can't get when you book with a national organization like Red Cross. Firstly, by booking with us, you'll be supporting a local business and helping to keep money within the community. Not only is this great for the local economy, but it also means that you'll be working with a team that truly understands the unique needs of the area.Additionally, booking with a local provider like Kallective Wellness CPR means that you'll have access to highly personalized service. Unlike with a national organization, where you may be treated like just another number, we take the time to get to know our clients and their specific needs. We can work with you to create a customized training program that meets the exact needs of your business, and we'll be there to answer any questions you may have along the way.And let's not forget about the cost savings! With Red Cross charging $126 per student and $250 per instructor, with a minimum billing of eight students per class, you could end up paying significantly more than you need to. With our base level courses starting at just $80 and instructor fees of $175 per session, you'll enjoy significant cost savings without sacrificing quality. Plus, with no training student minimum or maximum, you can easily accommodate the needs of small or large groups.So if you're looking for high-quality CPR training that's tailored to your unique needs, and that won't break the bank, then look no further than Kallective Wellness CPR.
