Here, we are specifically\ninterested in what eye movements reveal about how the content of information\nvisualizations is processed. Conversely, by pooling over many observers\u2019 worth\nof eye movements, what can we learn about the general effectiveness of different\nvisualizations and the underlying design principles employed? The contribution of\nthis manuscript is to consider these questions at a large data scale, with thousands of\neye fixations on hundreds of diverse information visualizations. We survey existing\nmethods and metrics for collective eye movement analysis, and consider what each\ncan tell us about the overall effectiveness of different information visualizations and\ndesigns at this large data scale.\n1 Introduction\nEye movements can provide us with clues about the elements of a visual display that\npeople pay attention to, what they spend most time on, and how they redirect their\nattention between elements. The eyes can also be used as indicators of higher-level\ncognitive processing like memory, comprehension, and problem solving [21, 23, 32,\n39, 40, 54].\n\nZ. Bylinskii () \u2022 A.

Bylinskii et al.\nEye movement analyses have been used to study the perception of natural\n\nscenes, simple artificial stimuli, webpages, user interfaces, and increasingly, infor-\nmation visualizations. In human-computer interaction (HCI), eye tracking has\n\noften been used for evaluating the usability of systems and studying the related\nquestion of interface design [13, 19, 29, 47]. Duchowski provides a survey of\ndifferent eye-tracking applications in domains ranging from industrial engineering\nto marketing [13].\n\nIn the visualization community, eye-tracking analyses have been used to inde-\npendently evaluate different visualizations (e.g., graphs [25\u201327, 39, 49], node-link\n\ndiagrams [1], tree diagrams [8], parallel coordinates [62]) and to directly compare\nvisualization types [6, 11, 17]. Eye tracking has also been used to understand how\na person visually perceives, explores, searches, and remembers a visualization,\nproviding a window into the cognitive processes involved when interacting with\nvisualizations [1, 3, 6, 11, 26, 37, 49, 50, 53].\nInformation visualizations are specifically designed to be parsed and understood\nby human observers. Visualizations can be created to help convey a specific message\nto a general audience, or to help data analysts extract trends and meaning from\nthe data. As visualizations are amenable to specific tasks, observer performance\non those tasks can be directly measured (e.g., ability to find a specific piece of\ninformation, to solve an analysis task, to remember the content for later retrieval,\netc.). Eye movement analyses can then be used to provide possible explanations of\ntask performance (e.g., why a task was completed quicker with one visualization\ndesign as compared to another), as complementary performance measurements that\ntake into account human perception. Eye movements can provide a window into\nthe cognitive processing taking place when an observer examines an information\nvisualization.\nAlthough different eye movement metrics have been previously reviewed within\nthe context of different tasks [1, 17, 29, 51], in this manuscript we focus specifically\non eye fixation metrics that can be used for collective analysis (the aggregation of\n\ndata across a population of observers and visualizations) of information visualiza-\ntion designs. We provide a review of metrics that can be used for the quantitative\n\ncomparison of different visualization designs in a large data setting. Unlike many\nprevious studies, our analyses are broad, spanning a large diversity of visualization\ntypes and sources. We discuss and visualize ways in which different metrics can\nbe used to evaluate the effectiveness of different visualization designs, and we\nuse the MASSVIS dataset [6] to provide some specific examples. The review\nprovided in this manuscript is intended to motivate further research into large-scale\neye movement analysis for the broad comparison and evaluation of visualization\ndesigns.\n\nEye Fixation Metrics for Large Scale Evaluation 237\n2 Methods\n2.1 Visualization Data\nWe used the MASSVIS dataset of 393 labeled target visualizations,1 spanning\nfour different source categories: government and world organizations, news media,\ninfographics, and scientific publications [6]. These visualizations were manually\n\nlabeled using the LabelMe system [59] and Borkin et al.\u2019s visualization taxon-\nomy [7] (Fig. 1a). Labels classify visualization elements as: data encoding, data-\nrelated components (e.g., axes, annotations, legends), textual elements (e.g., title,\n\naxis labels, paragraphs), pictograms or human recognizable objects, or graphical\nelements with no data encoding function. Labels can overlap in that a single region\ncan have a number of labels (e.g., an annotation on a graph has an annotation label\nand a graph label). Labels are available for analyses as segmented polygons.\n\n2.2 Eye-tracking Experiments\nWe used eye movements collected during the encoding experimental phase from\nthe study by Borkin et al. [6]. During this phase, each visualization was shown\nto participants for 10 s, producing an average of 37.4 (SD: 3.2) eye fixations\nper visualization, or an average 623 (SD: 93) total fixations per visualization.\nThis duration proved to be of sufficient length for a participant to read the\nvisualization\u2019s title, axes, annotations, etc., as well as explore the data encoding,\nand short enough to avoid too much redundancy in fixation patterns and explorative\nstrategies. Participants were told to remember as many details of each visualization\nas possible for subsequent experimental phases. During the recognition and recall\nphases, respectively, participants completed a memory task and were asked to write\ndescriptions of the visualizations they remembered. We do not directly use this\nadditional data in the present manuscript, but refer to the conclusions made from\nthe eye movement analyses in the context of memory performances.\nEye movements of 33 participants were recorded on 393 target visualizations,\nwith an average of 16.7 viewers (SD: 1.98) per visualization. Equipment included\nan SR Research EyeLink1000 desktop eye-tracker [63] with a chin-rest mount 22 in\nfrom a 19 in CRT monitor (1280 1024 pixels). For each eye fixation, available for\nanalysis are its spatial location in pixel coordinates, duration in milliseconds, and\nordering within the entire viewing episode (scanpath).\n\n1Dataset available at http://massvis.mit.edu.\n\n238 Z. Bylinskii et al.\n\nFig. 1 We plot the fixations of a single observer for demonstration purposes, to visually depict a\nfew key terms used throughout this manuscript. (a) The images we use are labeled with AOIs\n(Areas of Interest), which are elements like the title, axes, and legend. (b) Fixations are the\ndiscrete locations that an observer\u2019s eyes have landed on at some point during the viewing episode.\n(c) Multiple consecutive fixations that land on the same AOIs of an image can be further clustered\ninto gazes. The size of the gaze marker is proportional to the number of fixations making up\nthe gaze, with the marker centered at the mean of those fixation locations. (d) A scanpath is the\nsequence of fixations made. Here, to denote the temporal ordering, fixations are connected by lines,\nnumerically labeled, and colored such that the earliest are in red and the latest in yellow\n2.3 Metrics and Visualizations\nDepending on the analysis being performed, different aspects of eye movement\nbehavior can be measured including fixation locations, fixation durations, and\nsaccades.2 Fixations are discrete samples of where an eye was looking on a visual\ndisplay obtained from continuous eye movement data3 (Fig. 1b). By segmenting the\nvisual stimulus into elements or Areas of Interest, denoted AOI, fixations falling\non different AOIs can be separately analyzed (Fig. 1a). Consecutive fixations on a\nspecific region or AOI can be further clustered into gazes (Fig. 1c).\n2Saccades are intervals between fixations: the motion of the eyes from one fixation point to the\nnext. The analysis of saccades is beyond the scope of the present manuscript, for which additional\nmetrics would be necessary [40, 51].\n3The eye has to be recorded as \u201cstill\u201d according to prespecified parameters [24, 60]. We use the\nstandard thresholds set by the EyeLink Eyetracker [63].\n\nEye Fixation Metrics for Large Scale Evaluation 239\nApart from summarizing the number and duration of fixations on a visual design\nor its constituent elements, the spatial and sequential aspects of a viewing episode\ncan be used to compute additional measurements of eye movement behavior for\nvisual design analysis. For instance, the spatial distribution of fixations can be\ncaptured by the moments of the distribution or the coverage (proportion of visual\ndesign fixated at a particular threshold value, Sect. 3.3). The temporal ordering\n(sequence) of fixations is often referred to as the scanpath [45] and is common\nfor analyzing search tasks (Fig. 1d). For instance, one can consider the sequence of\nAOIs observers fixate while searching for a target or a specific piece of information.\nQuantitative eye movement measurements used by previous visualization studies\nare summarized in Table 1. A review of the most common eye measurements\nacross usability studies more generally is provided by Jacob and Karn [29]. The\n5 most common metrics reported across 24 usability studies also appear in Table 1.\nDifferent metrics emphasize different aspects of eye movement behavior, which are\nin turn linked to different underlying cognitive processes. The number or density\nof fixations allocated to a visual area has been linked to its importance [29, 52];\nfixation duration in a visual area has been linked to the area\u2019s information content\nor complexity [32]; and the transitions between fixations have been found to be\nrelated to the search behavior and expectations of the viewer [15, 44, 54]. Patterns\nin the fixation data of a group of observers can also be used to highlight design\nTable 1 Eye movement metrics commonly reported in usability studies [29] and for evaluation\nand comparison of information visualizations. Different perception studies have used these metrics\nto make conclusions about the importance and noticeability of different visual elements, and to\nreason about the difficulty of the perception task and the complexity of the visual design [51]. AOI\nrefers to an Area of Interest, which can be a component of a graph like the title, axis, or legend\n\nVisualization\n\nQuantitative measurements studies Possible interpretations\nSummary measurements\nTotal number of fixationsa [17, 39] Efficiency of searching or engagement\n\n[12, 19, 32]\n\nTotal number of gazes [11] Complexity of inferential process [11]\nMean fixation durationa Complexity or engagement [32]\nAOI measurements\n\nFixations on AOIsa (propor-\ntion or number)\n\n[8, 37, 62] Element importance or noticeability [52]\n\nGazes on AOIsa (proportion\nor number)\n\n[11] Element importance or noticeability [29]\n\nViewing time on AOIsa (pro-\nportion or total)\n\n[11, 37, 62] Information content, complexity, or\n\nengagement [32]\n\nTime to first fixation on an\nAOI\n\n[17, 39, 62] Attention-getting properties [10]\n\nMostly qualitative analysis [25\u201327, 49, 53] Relative complexity or efficiency of dif-\nferent designs\n\naThe marked metrics are the 5 most commonly-reported across a total of 24 usability studies\nsurveyed by Jacob and Karn [29]\n\n240 Z.

For instance, the order of fixations has been\nfound to be indicative of the efficiency of the arrangement of visual elements [15].\nA visualization designer might be interested in ensuring that the important elements\nare more likely to be fixated early.\nThe use of different types of visualizations for highlighting properties of eye\nmovement data have also been useful for complementing and facilitating analysis\nover groups of observers [1, 18, 41, 57, 64, 66, 68, 69]. A number of previous\nvisualization studies relied mostly on such qualitative analyses (Table 1). Blascheck\net al. provide a review of visualizations and visual analytics tools for eye movement\ndata [3]. While visualizations can facilitate data exploration, inferences made from\neye movement data are more meaningful when supported by quantitative metrics.\nFor the explorative analysis of the MASSVIS eye movement data, we utilize\nfixation heatmaps due to their versatility, scalability, and interpretability. Fixation\nheatmaps are constructed by aggregating a set of fixations and placing a Gaussian4\nat each fixation location. The result is a continuous distribution that can be plotted on\n\ntop of the image to highlight elements receiving the most attention. This simple visu-\nalization is particularly amenable to collective analysis, allowing us to visualize the\n\nfixations of any number of observers on a single image. To highlight different trends\n\nin the eye movements, we aggregate over different subsets of the data: distinct fixa-\ntion durations (Fig. 2), time points during the viewing episode (Fig. 3), and observers\n\n(Fig. 4). Our coverage plots are also just thresholded fixation heatmaps (Fig. 5).\nWe note that eye movement analyses are most informative in the context of\nan objective task that an observer performs. In such cases, eye movements are\nmore likely to be related to task completion itself. Furthermore, eye movement\nanalyses can be used to complement, and provide possible explanations for, other\nobjective performance measurements (e.g., speed or accuracy of task completion).\nConsidered in isolation, eye movement measurements can be open to interpretation,\nand thus they should complement, not replace, other measurements. For example,\nthe eye movements from the MASSVIS dataset were collected in the context of\nmemory and recall tasks. Participants\u2019 fixations were recorded as they examined\nvisualizations, knowing they would have to retrieve the details from memory later.\nIn this manuscript, our focus is on the eye movement metrics themselves and how\nthey can be used for the evaluation and comparison of information visualizations\nmore broadly.
