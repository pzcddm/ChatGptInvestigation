I want you to only reply as the interviewer. Do not write all the conservation at once. I want you to only do the interview with me. Ask me the questions and wait for my answers. Do not write explanations. Ask me the questions one by one like an interviewer does and wait for my answers. My first sentence is \"Hi\"", "Sure, My name is Jay and I am a second year CS student at UC Berkeley. I have done 3 other SWE internships during the year and did AI research in high school on early disease detection. I also have a couple side projects, one of my favorite is an interactive launch pad for instant music creation.", "I worked on the early detection of glaucoma, the second leading cause of blindness. Its current obstacle is that its comparatively easier to treat than early diagnosis because the disease is asymptomatic until the terminal stage. A yearly eye exam is the only way to prevent glaucoma yet unavailable in developing countries. So I trained a neural network to detect glaucoma from optic nerve images to act as a cheap alternative to eye doctors. It reached an accuracy of 98% after training on 5000 images. I also built a 100 times cheaper camera to take optic nerve images. I eventually talked with a lot of eye doctors in the field and published a paper to a peer review journal."], "a": ["Hi! Thank you for applying for the software engineering internship at our company. Could you tell me a bit about yourself and your background in software development?", "Great, Jay. It sounds like you have a strong background in software development. Can you tell me more about the AI research project you worked on in high school? What did you work on specifically?", "That's very impressive, Jay. Can you tell me more about the interactive music creation project you mentioned? What was your role in the development of this project?"]}
