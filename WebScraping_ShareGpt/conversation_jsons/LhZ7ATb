{"num": 1.0, "q": ["what is the filed of view of a DJI zenmuse h20T wide camera at 120 meters"], "a": ["The field of view of a camera is typically measured in terms of the angle of view, which is the angle between the two extreme rays of the image that pass through the lens and converge at the focal point. However, the exact field of view of the DJI Zenmuse H20T camera will depend on the specific lens being used, as this camera is compatible with several different lens options.Assuming that the DJI Zenmuse H20T camera is equipped with the wide-angle lens option, which has a focal length of 4.44 mm and a horizontal field of view of 82.9\u00b0, the field of view at 120 meters would be approximately:Horizontal Field of View at 120 meters = (Distance * Tan(Horizontal Angle of View / 2)) * 2Horizontal Field of View at 120 meters = (120 * Tan(82.9\u00b0 / 2)) * 2Horizontal Field of View at 120 meters = 306.84 metersThis means that at a distance of 120 meters, the DJI Zenmuse H20T camera with the wide-angle lens would have a horizontal field of view of approximately 306.84 meters. However, it's worth noting that this calculation is based on some assumptions and approximations, and the actual field of view may vary depending on various factors such as atmospheric conditions and camera settings."]}
