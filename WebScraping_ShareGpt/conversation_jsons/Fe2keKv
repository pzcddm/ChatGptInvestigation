Please send me the resume so I can begin reviewing it.", "Here are my suggestions for your resume:General:I recommend including a summary or objective statement at the top of your resume. This should be a brief overview of your skills and experience, and should highlight the value you can bring to an employer.Consider using bullet points to list your education, work experience, and projects. This will make the information easier to scan and understand.I recommend including specific details and metrics where possible to give your resume more substance and impact. For example, instead of saying \"I managed a team of software engineers,\" you could say \"Managed a team of 10 software engineers using OKR, resulting in the successful launch of the first product in two months.\"Make sure to proofread your resume carefully to ensure that there are no typos or grammatical errors.Education:It's not necessary to include your expected graduation date if you are currently enrolled in a degree program.Consider including a section for relevant coursework, where you can list specific classes and skills that are relevant to the positions you are applying for.Work experience:Make sure to include the dates of employment for each job you list.Try to use action verbs and specific metrics to describe your responsibilities and accomplishments. For example, instead of saying \"I improved the accuracy of the detection tasks,\" you could say \"Improved detection tasks' accuracy by 20% by building an ML-based computer vision algorithm with OpenCV and YoloV5.\"Projects:As with your work experience, use action verbs and specific metrics to describe your responsibilities and accomplishments.Consider including links to any relevant project materials, such as code repositories or demo websites.Skills:Consider organizing your skills into categories, such as programming languages, tools and frameworks, and technical skills.Make sure to include any relevant certifications or awards you have received.I hope these suggestions are helpful! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like further feedback."]}
