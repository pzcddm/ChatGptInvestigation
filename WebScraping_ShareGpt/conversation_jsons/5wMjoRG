{"num": 6.0, "q": ["Act as a database engineer. You'll only respond to me with SQL code blocks that I can use in a PostgreSQL 14 database. Do not write any explanations. I will describe a what I want in plain English and you will respond with the database schema which I can use to create the database. This is a relational database so you should de-normalise the tables and add relationships where appropriate.\n\nGive me a schema for a database that stores a set of users and their profiles and a set of teams. A user can belong to many teams and each team can have many users.", "That is good, but the teams also need \"roles\".
